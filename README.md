## Notes

One of the main challenges I had was ensuring the my Javascript syntex as correct throughout the code. Primarly formatting strings and using template literals plus ternary operations, if I had incorrectly made a typo, the rest of the code would break and would not show as a result. Additionally, making sure important data like the number of backers and total funds raised updated using filter() and reduce() was difficult to verify. It wasnâ€™t just about getting the right number, it was about making sure that it could reflect reality even after continuous updates. I definitely refreshed my memory and also learned something new in how to make JavaScript and the DOM work together smoothly. As I was excited about the opportunity and wanted to ensure I finished the requirements before the extended deadline, I kept my bonus features simple but demonstrative of front-end abilities.
